## Table Structure:

    Make sure that the products table has a column named product_type and that it's the correct data type to store these values. If the column doesn't exist or if its data type is incorrect, you'll encounter errors.

## Encoding:

    Setting utf8mb4 is a good practice for supporting a wider range of characters, especially if your product names might include special characters or emojis.
SET NAMES utf8mb4;


## This is for my database product list.



INSERT INTO `products` (`product_type`) VALUES
('tharik'),
('SMART WATCH'),
('MOBILE'),
('WATCH');
